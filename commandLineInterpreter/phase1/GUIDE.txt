For Easy Access The Intermediate File Will Be Formatted As Such

For Every Line Of Code In Between START and END (including comments) we will have 8 lines in the intermediate file
[1]copy of source line
[2]location counter
[3]label 
[4]mnemonic ([operations] -or- [directive])
[5]operand
[6]comment
[7]errors
[\n]

----------Error Codes (will be surround by 2 Xs... EX: x000x)
---Special Codes [0]
000 -> "fileName" was not found -or- did not open properly
010 -> no START directive found (make sure you have a legal label in front of your start directive)
020 -> no END directive found (make sure there is some space in front of your end directive [space != label])
---Label Codes [1]

---Mneumonic Codes [2]
200 -> you have an extra START directive
201 -> invalid mneumonic (operation -or- directive )
